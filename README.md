This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Running the Project with Docker

To build and run the project within a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose build
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. The application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Stopping the Docker container:**

    To stop the running container, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running, or run:

    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```
